Playbook helps humans and AI agents understand, govern, and safely change real repositories through deterministic repo intelligence and reviewed remediation.

Playbook is not positioned as a general-purpose chat assistant. It is the runtime between assistants and production codebases: explicit contracts, deterministic findings, and policy-gated change loops.

## Category and product claim

Playbook is best understood as **deterministic repo intelligence + governance + safe remediation runtime**:

- **Read substrate**: `ai-context`, `ai-contract`, `index`, `query`, `knowledge`, `deps`, `ask --repo-context`, `explain`
- **Governance kernel**: `verify`
- **Change bridge**: `plan -> apply -> verify`
- **Delivery surfaces**: one engine used via CLI, CI, automation, and integrations

This framing is the core promise: deterministic evidence over ad-hoc inference, and reviewed intent before execution.

Playbook now treats verification, publishing, and deployment as separate workflow concepts. Verification truth can be produced entirely locally through a repo-defined `verify:local` gate and durable `.playbook/local-verification-receipt.json` evidence. Remote providers such as GitHub remain optional transports for PR review, CI orchestration, and publishing sync.

The reusable workflow-pack boundary is frozen through `docs/contracts/WORKFLOW_PACK_REUSE_CONTRACT.md` and published for downstream discovery through `pnpm playbook contracts --json`, so consumer repos can adopt the same verification, promotion, versioning, and consumer-boundary contracts without inventing local dialects.

For UI-governance stacks that already own semantic and visual proof lanes elsewhere, Playbook now also ships a reusable compatibility action at `.github/actions/atlas-ui-proof/action.yml`. That action reruns ATLAS semantic drift, reruns ATLAS visual proof, derives the combined `runtime/atlas/ui-proof/fitness/latest.json` summary, and fails closed when the proof summary is missing, unreadable, red, or empty.

Operator-facing text surfaces should stay brief-thin: lead with decision/status, affected surfaces, blockers, and next action, while leaving machine-heavy state in JSON contracts and `.playbook/*` artifacts.

- Rule: Human surfaces should show decision, action, and why — not raw machine state.
- Pattern: Artifact-rich, brief-thin operator surfaces keep review fast.
- Failure Mode: Making humans parse machine-oriented artifacts slows review and pushes important decisions off the visible surface.

Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook test-autofix --input <path> --json` now closes the bounded test-remediation loop by orchestrating `test-triage`, `test-fix-plan`, `apply --from-plan`, and the exact narrow-first rerun plan already emitted by triage, while still preserving the same reviewed execution boundary and explicit final-status classification.
Recent implementation note: `test-autofix` now also persists `.playbook/test-autofix-history.json` as the evidence layer for bounded self-repair, recording stable failure signatures, admitted vs excluded findings, applied repair classes, verification outcomes, and provenance back to the failure log, triage artifact, fix-plan artifact, apply result, and final autofix artifact so repeat detection can become trustworthy before retry policy is automated.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook test-fix-plan --from-triage <artifact> --json` now exposes the bounded remediation seam after diagnosis, turning only pre-approved low-risk `test-triage` findings into stable apply-compatible tasks while preserving risky or unsupported findings as explicit exclusions. Those artifacts are now accepted directly by `pnpm playbook apply --from-plan`, which reuses the existing approved-plan execution boundary instead of introducing a separate mutation path.
Recent implementation note: `test-autofix` now evaluates a deterministic repeat-aware remediation policy between history lookup and mutation, using stable failure signatures plus remediation history to allow one bounded repair attempt, surface a previously successful repair class as preferred guidance, or stop/escalate before replaying a known-bad fix. This slice still performs only one bounded repair attempt per run and does not introduce recursive autofix loops.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook remediation-status --json` is now the canonical read-only soak surface for operators, aggregating the latest autofix result, remediation history, stable failure signatures, repeat-policy decisions, preferred repair classes, blocked retries, safe-to-retry signatures, confidence calibration buckets, failure-class success rates, blocked-low-confidence telemetry, conservative-confidence advisory signals, and deterministic soak rollups for failure classes, repair classes, blocked signatures, threshold counterfactuals, dry-run/apply deltas, and manual-review pressure so trust does not depend on reading raw artifacts by hand. This telemetry is tuning/observation only and does not widen mutation authority or introduce a second policy engine.
Recent implementation note: repository CI now captures failed `pnpm test` output to `.playbook/ci-failure.log`, runs canonical `test-autofix` in dry-run mode on protected branches, requires `autofix_confidence >= confidence_threshold` before any mutation path is allowed, uploads the resulting `.playbook/` remediation artifacts in both dry-run and apply modes, and renders one sticky PR remediation comment from those artifacts without introducing workflow-local repair logic.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook test-triage` now doubles as Playbook's first-class failure-summary surface, normalizing Vitest/pnpm/GitHub Actions failures into deterministic `status`, `summary`, `primaryFailureClass`, `failures[]`, `crossCuttingDiagnosis[]`, and `recommendedNextChecks[]` fields while still preserving raw CI logs for auditability. CI now emits `.playbook/failure-summary.json` plus `.playbook/failure-summary.md` and appends the markdown summary directly to the GitHub step summary for copy-paste-ready remediation context.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook learn doctrine --json` now provides a first-class report-only post-merge learning surface that turns merged change summaries into reusable Rule / Pattern / Failure Mode suggestions, notes-update guidance, and candidate future verification checks without auto-promoting doctrine into source-of-truth docs.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook interop emit-fitness-plan --from-draft .playbook/interop-request-draft.json` now closes the explicit bounded interop loop by consuming only the canonical draft artifact, re-validating canonical Fitness action/input/receipt/routing metadata before emit, and then reusing the existing bounded emit runtime path without hidden execution.
Rule: AI proposals may be compiled into bounded request drafts, but may not execute them directly.
Rule: Updated truth must resolve into explicit next-step artifacts, not implicit operator memory.
Rule: Updated truth should feed existing governed review surfaces before inventing new workflow silos.
Pattern: AI proposal -> request draft -> explicit interop emit -> receipt -> updated truth -> review cue.
Failure Mode: Manual proposal-to-request translation recreates hidden session state and weakens auditability.
Failure Mode: The loop claims to derive next action, but that action remains trapped in a followup artifact no operator workflow actually consumes.
Recent implementation note: promoted reusable patterns now carry explicit lifecycle truth (`active`, `superseded`, `retired`, `demoted`), lifecycle mutations emit audited receipts through `pnpm playbook promote pattern-retire|pattern-demote|pattern-recall|pattern-supersede`, and advisory planning context consumes only active promoted knowledge by default.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook receipt ingest --json` now converts receipts, drift signals, rollback/deactivation notes, promotion history, and later portability outcomes into reviewable `.playbook/memory/lifecycle-candidates.json` rows that stay candidate-only until explicit human lifecycle review.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook docs consolidate --json` now provides a deterministic proposal-only docs seam for protected singleton narrative surfaces by reading worker fragments plus the protected-surface registry, writing `.playbook/docs-consolidation.json`, surfacing duplicate/conflicting fragment targets explicitly, and emitting one compact lead-agent integration brief without introducing any new doc mutation executor.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook docs consolidate-plan --json` now compiles `.playbook/docs-consolidation.json` into the first-class `.playbook/docs-consolidation-plan.json` reviewed-write artifact, stamping target-locked file/block fingerprints or anchor context onto each executable task so `pnpm playbook apply --from-plan .playbook/docs-consolidation-plan.json` fails closed if reviewed protected-doc targets drift before execution. Protected singleton docs still mutate only through `apply --from-plan`, so consolidation planning does not become a shadow executor.
Recent implementation note: `pnpm playbook apply` now enforces declared `.playbook/change-scope.json` mutation bundles before execution succeeds, including `allowedFiles`, `patchSizeBudget`, and required `boundaryChecks`, and fails clearly when scope checks are missing, red, or exceeded.
Recent implementation note: worker launch/submit authorization now threads `.playbook/change-scope.json` into lane evaluation, publishes per-lane declared write surfaces from the scope bundle, and rejects out-of-scope or budget-overrun worker submissions before lane-state mutation.
Recent implementation note: Codex-facing mutating prompt compilation now requires explicit `Acceptance Criteria`, `Expected Changed Paths`, `Expected Unchanged Paths`, and `Blocked / Skipped Reporting Rules` across `route`, `orchestrate`, worker lane prompts, and fleet-adoption execution packaging, making summary text non-authoritative and keeping diff-proof expectations explicit at the prompt boundary.
Rule: Declared mutation scope must be enforced before apply succeeds.
Rule: Managed workers may operate only within declared mutation scope.
Pattern: Declare scope -> enforce scope -> mutate -> receipt.
Pattern: Launch-plan + change-scope -> eligible execution.
Failure Mode: Scope bundles that are not enforced become advisory paperwork instead of real safety boundaries.
Failure Mode: Worker authorization without scope enforcement recreates hidden mutation boundaries.

## Shared core, project-local intelligence

Playbook uses a **shared core + project-local Playbook state** integration model:

- The Playbook product (CLI/engine/contracts) is shared core.
- Playbook is designed to be installed **per repository**, not as a required global binary.
- Installing Playbook in a consumer repository creates **project-local Playbook state** (config, index/artifacts, plans, and repository-specific extensions), not a fork by default.
- Repository observations stay local/private by default.
- Reusable patterns and product improvements are promoted upstream intentionally (docs/roadmap/rules), not via hidden mutation.

Pattern: **private-first by default**. Standard Playbook usage does not imply automatic upstream content export.

Pattern: **config/plugins/rule packs over forks** for project-specific customization.

## Runtime artifacts and storage

Playbook uses `.playbook/` as the default home for local runtime artifacts (for example repository intelligence indexes, plans, and machine-readable reports).
Playbook also publishes checked-in machine-readable Lifeline presets under `exports/lifeline/` so external tooling can consume stable defaults directly from a local Playbook checkout without starting the Playbook UI.

### Run Playbook with Lifeline

Playbook can be used as both the Lifeline convention source and the app target runtime from the same local checkout:

- `exports/lifeline/` stays intentionally sparse and generic for shared archetype defaults.
- `.lifeline/playbook.lifeline.yml` is the checked-in explicit runnable app target for this repository.

From a machine with both repositories checked out locally:

```bash
lifeline resolve .lifeline/playbook.lifeline.yml --playbook-path <path-to-playbook>
lifeline up .lifeline/playbook.lifeline.yml --playbook-path <path-to-playbook>
lifeline status playbook
lifeline logs playbook
lifeline down playbook
```

The app process started by Lifeline is `pnpm start:lifeline`, which preserves the normal local Playbook CLI and terminal-based development flow.
Playbook routing inspection emits deterministic proposal-only execution plans at `.playbook/execution-plan.json` via `pnpm playbook route "<task>" --json`.

Wave 1 restart posture shadow codification lives in [docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_LIFELINE_WAVE_1_RESTART_POSTURE.md](docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_LIFELINE_WAVE_1_RESTART_POSTURE.md). It records the proof-gated checklist, decisions, failure modes, and parity criteria Playbook should mirror without taking over Lifeline implementation.

Layer ownership + closed-loop reference: [`docs/architecture/CONTROL_LOOP_AND_LAYER_OWNERSHIP.md`](docs/architecture/CONTROL_LOOP_AND_LAYER_OWNERSHIP.md).

- Generated runtime artifacts should generally be gitignored unless intentionally committed as stable contracts/examples.
- Committed demo artifacts under `.playbook/demo-artifacts/` are product-facing snapshot contracts and examples, not general-purpose runtime logs.
- Allowed committed `.playbook` content is limited to curated contract/example fixtures (`.playbook/demo-artifacts/*.example.json`) and explicit governance metadata (`.playbook/pr-metadata.json`); generated runtime outputs like `.playbook/repo-index.json` and `.playbook/repo-graph.json` must remain untracked.
- Playbook remains local/private-first by default: local scanning and artifact generation do not imply automatic cloud sync or upstream export.

Pattern: Runtime Artifacts Live Under `.playbook/`.
Pattern: Demo Artifacts Are Snapshot Contracts, Not General Runtime State.
Rule: Generated runtime artifacts should be gitignored unless intentionally committed as stable contracts/examples.
Rule: Playbook remains local/private-first by default.
Failure Mode: Recommitting regenerated runtime artifacts on every run causes unnecessary repository-history growth and review noise.

## Playbook artifact lifecycle

Playbook classifies repository artifacts into deterministic storage classes:

- **Runtime artifacts**: local outputs like `.playbook/repo-index.json`, `.playbook/plan.json`, `.playbook/verify.json`, `.playbook/session.json`, session cleanup reports, and cache files.
- **Automation artifacts**: CI handoff outputs such as CI plan and verification artifacts.
- **Contract artifacts**: committed snapshots and docs contracts like `tests/contracts/*.snapshot.json`, `.playbook/demo-artifacts/*`, and generated diagram documentation.

Use `.playbookignore` to control repository intelligence scan scope for `pnpm playbook index` and other repository scans. The syntax mirrors `.gitignore`.

Safe bootstrap flow:

```
pnpm playbook pilot --repo "<target-repo-path>" --json
pnpm playbook ignore suggest --repo "<target-repo-path>" --json
pnpm playbook ignore apply --repo "<target-repo-path>" --safe-defaults
```

`ignore suggest` reads ranked runtime recommendations and reports which entries are already covered. `ignore apply --safe-defaults` writes only `safe-default` entries into a deterministic managed block and leaves `review-first` recommendations as manual review items.

`pnpm playbook doctor` now includes a **Playbook Artifact Hygiene** section to detect artifact misuse and suggest deterministic fixes.

## Quick Start (canonical ladder)

Playbook operator workflows assume a **repo-local CLI install** (for example `node_modules/.bin/playbook` via `pnpm playbook ...`), so clean machines and CI do not depend on PATH-global Playbook binaries.

### Command truth

- The canonical operator-facing invocation form is `pnpm playbook <command>`.
- Direct execution via `node packages/cli/dist/main.js <command>` is internal/debug-oriented unless explicitly called out for implementation workflows.
- Do not use `npx`-based package examples for operator guidance unless Playbook publish/distribution docs explicitly reintroduce that path.

Run the canonical Playbook-first operating ladder:

```bash
pnpm playbook ai-context --json
pnpm playbook ai-contract --json
pnpm playbook context --json
pnpm playbook index --json
pnpm playbook query modules --json
pnpm playbook explain architecture --json
pnpm playbook ask "where should a new feature live?" --repo-context --json
pnpm playbook verify --json
pnpm playbook verify --local --json
pnpm playbook plan --json --out .playbook/plan.json
pnpm playbook apply --from-plan .playbook/plan.json
pnpm playbook apply --from-plan .playbook/test-fix-plan.json
pnpm playbook test-autofix --input .playbook/ci-failure.log --json
pnpm playbook verify --json
```

`analyze` remains available for compatibility and lightweight stack inspection, but it is no longer the sole serious quick-start path.

For a fully local verification loop, run:

```bash
pnpm playbook verify --local --json
pnpm playbook verify --local-only --json
```

If the repository defines `package.json#scripts.verify:local`, Playbook uses that command as the local verification gate. The receipt written to `.playbook/local-verification-receipt.json` is the source of truth for verification in this mode.

For downstream discovery of the reusable workflow-pack bundle, run `pnpm playbook contracts --json` and consume the registered workflow-pack docs plus schema entries rather than hard-coding artifact assumptions in each consumer repo.

When a downstream control plane needs one completion-facing signal for UI work, prefer the read-only ATLAS proof summary projection over inventing a repo-local status dialect. The Playbook reusable action only consumes that projection; it does not redefine verification truth or move UI ownership into Playbook.

For local branch-accurate validation inside this repository, prefer:

```bash
pnpm playbook plan --json --out .playbook/plan.json
pnpm playbook apply --from-plan .playbook/plan.json --json
```

PowerShell-safe local equivalent:

```powershell
pnpm playbook plan --json --out .playbook/plan.json
pnpm playbook apply --from-plan .playbook/plan.json --json
```

For a no-install preview flow:

```bash
pnpm playbook demo
```

`pnpm playbook demo` follows the same canonical serious-user ladder (`ai-context -> ai-contract -> context -> index -> query/explain -> verify -> plan -> apply -> verify`) and does not use `fix` as the primary onboarding path.

### External repo targeting

Use `--repo <path>` to run Playbook from this monorepo against another local repository without changing directories:

```bash
TARGET_REPO_PATH="../my-repo"
pnpm playbook --repo "$TARGET_REPO_PATH" index --json
pnpm playbook --repo "$TARGET_REPO_PATH" query modules --json
```

This keeps `pnpm playbook <command>` as the canonical invocation while letting operators target external repositories deterministically from a single working checkout.

### Consumer repository runtime resolution contract

Consumer repositories should resolve Playbook using this deterministic order:

1. `PLAYBOOK_BIN` override (explicit operator/CI choice).
2. Repo-local installed CLI (`node_modules/.bin/playbook`, typically via `pnpm playbook ...`).
3. Optional local-checkout development fallback (non-canonical; temporary development aid only).
4. Explicit failure with actionable guidance.

Rules:

- Global PATH-based `playbook` resolution is non-canonical and must never be required for successful operation.
- Missing runtime resolution must fail loudly with actionable setup guidance; silent PATH assumptions are not allowed.
- Development fallbacks must remain opt-in and must not become the default runtime path.

When `--repo` is set, runtime artifacts are written into the target repository under `.playbook/` (for example `repo-index.json`, `repo-graph.json`, `findings.json`, `plan.json`, and runtime cycle artifacts).

For machine-consumed JSON artifacts, use CLI-owned output flags (for example `--json --out ...`). Shell redirection is not a supported canonical artifact-generation path.

### External Repo Pilot

Canonical command:

```bash
pnpm playbook pilot --repo "./target-repo"
```

Optional convenience alias:

```bash
pnpm playbook pilot --repo "./target-repo"
```

Optional convenience alias:

```bash
pnpm pilot "./target-repo"
```

`playbook pilot` executes one deterministic baseline cycle (`context -> index -> query modules -> verify -> plan`), writes machine-readable artifacts directly, records one top-level runtime cycle with child phases, and emits a compact final summary.

Artifacts written in the target repository:

- `.playbook/repo-index.json` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/repo-graph.json` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/findings.json` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/plan.json` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/pilot-summary.json` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/runtime/current/*` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/runtime/cycles/*` _(runtime-only, gitignored)_
- `.playbook/runtime/history/*`

Rule - Repeated Multi-Step Operator Flows Deserve a First-Class Command.

Pattern - Orchestrated Baseline Analysis.

Failure Mode - Manual Workflow Drift.

Failure Mode - Helper Script Becomes Shadow Product Surface.

External onboarding contract (minimal):

- `playbook.config.json` is optional; missing config is not a failure and Playbook runs with defaults.
- `.playbookignore` is optional; add it to tune repository scan scope for large/high-churn paths.
- `.playbook/` is runtime-generated Playbook state owned by Playbook commands for the target repo.
- first-run warning guidance is actionable: add `playbook.config.json` when you want explicit policy/config, add `.playbookignore` when scan scope should be narrowed.

Recommended follow-up after `pilot`:

```bash
pnpm playbook ignore suggest --repo "./target-repo" --json
pnpm playbook ignore apply --repo "./target-repo" --safe-defaults
```

Rule - Apply Only Trusted Ignore Recommendations.

Pattern - Recommendation Before Application, Safe Defaults Before Review.

Failure Mode - Auto-Applying Ambiguous Ignores.

Failure Mode - Non-Idempotent Ignore Management.

## CLI Commands

### Core

- `analyze`
- `verify`
- `plan`
- `apply`

### Repository tools

- `doctor`
- `diagram`
- `rules`
- `docs`
- `schema`
- `ignore`
- `context`
- `ai-context`
- `ai-contract`

### Repository Intelligence

- `index`
- `graph`
- `query`
- `knowledge`
- `deps`
- `ask`
- `explain`

For the complete command inventory (including utility commands), see [docs/commands/README.md](docs/commands/README.md).

Command truth packaging is metadata-driven via `packages/cli/src/lib/commandMetadata.ts` and generated as `docs/contracts/command-truth.json` (canonical vs compatibility vs utility + bootstrap/remediation sequencing).

Run `pnpm playbook index` to generate deterministic machine-readable repository intelligence artifacts at `.playbook/repo-index.json`, `.playbook/repo-graph.json`, and compressed module digests under `.playbook/context/modules/*.json`.

Complexity Through Compression: Playbook reduces repository complexity by extracting small deterministic artifacts (index -> graph -> module digests) and reusing them across query/explain/ask surfaces rather than repeatedly rescanning broad repository state.

Use `pnpm playbook schema` to retrieve the JSON Schema contracts for command outputs (`rules`, `explain`, `index`, `graph`, `verify`, `plan`, `context`, `ai-context`, `ai-contract`, `query`, `knowledge`, `docs`) so CI and agents can validate payloads.

## Playbook Context

Playbook provides deterministic machine-readable context for both humans and automation:

- `pnpm playbook context --json` returns broader CLI and architecture context.
- `pnpm playbook ai-context --json` returns a compact AI bootstrap payload.
- `pnpm playbook ai-contract --json` returns the repository AI-operability contract from `.playbook/ai-contract.json` (or deterministic generated defaults when missing).

## AI Bootstrap

AI tools can bootstrap repository understanding with:

```bash
pnpm playbook ai-context --json
pnpm playbook ai-contract --json
```

The payload is designed for:

- AI agents
- IDE assistants
- CI automation

Example AI-first flow:

```bash
pnpm playbook ai-context
pnpm playbook context
pnpm playbook index
pnpm playbook query modules
pnpm playbook ask "where should a new feature live?" --repo-context
pnpm playbook ask "how does auth work?" --repo-context --mode concise
pnpm playbook ask "how does this work?" --module workouts --repo-context
pnpm playbook ask "what modules are affected by this change?" --diff-context
pnpm playbook ask "how do I fix this rule violation?" --mode ultra
pnpm playbook explain architecture
pnpm playbook verify
pnpm playbook plan
pnpm playbook apply
```

`pnpm playbook context` is recommended in the AI bootstrap ladder for broader repository and CLI context before query/ask/explain.

Inside this repository, use the local built CLI entrypoint for branch-accurate validation:

```bash
pnpm -r build
pnpm playbook ai-context --json
pnpm playbook context --json
pnpm playbook docs audit --json
```

Preferred AI operating ladder: `ai-context -> ai-contract -> context -> index/query/explain/ask --repo-context -> verify/plan/apply`.

Future app-integration direction: app or dashboard actions should use a trusted **server-side Playbook API/runtime or library layer** for validated operations instead of executing arbitrary browser-side CLI commands directly.

Pattern: `pnpm playbook ai-context` is the preferred agent bootstrap command for Playbook-aware AI workflows.
Pattern: `.playbook/ai-contract.json` is the canonical AI-operability handshake artifact for Playbook-enabled repositories.
Rule: AI agents should prefer Playbook commands over broad repository inference when command coverage exists.
Rule: Inside the Playbook repo, use local built CLI entrypoints to reflect current branch behavior.
Pattern: `ai-context -> ai-contract -> context -> index/query/explain/ask --repo-context -> verify/plan/apply` is the preferred AI operating ladder.
Failure Mode: Agent drift occurs when AI tools bypass Playbook command outputs and reason directly from stale or incomplete file inspection.

### Querying Repository Intelligence

Use `pnpm playbook query` to read structured architecture metadata directly from `.playbook/repo-index.json` without rescanning your repository.

For modular-monolith repositories, Playbook indexes `src/features/*` directories as first-class modules (falling back to immediate `src/*` module directories when `src/features/*` is absent).

```bash
pnpm playbook index
pnpm playbook query modules
pnpm playbook query architecture
pnpm playbook query risk workouts
pnpm playbook query impact workouts
pnpm playbook query docs-coverage
pnpm playbook query rule-owners
pnpm playbook query test-hotspots
pnpm playbook knowledge list
pnpm playbook knowledge query --type candidate
pnpm playbook ask "where should a new feature live?"
pnpm playbook ask "what modules exist?" --json
pnpm playbook ask "how does auth work?" --repo-context --mode concise
pnpm playbook ask "how does this work?" --module workouts --repo-context
pnpm playbook ask "what modules are affected by this change?" --diff-context
pnpm playbook ask "how do I fix this rule violation?" --mode ultra
pnpm playbook explain workouts
pnpm playbook explain PB001
pnpm playbook explain architecture
```

`pnpm playbook knowledge` is the read-only inspection surface for normalized evidence, candidate knowledge, promoted doctrine, and superseded knowledge.

### Repo-aware ask (`pnpm playbook ask --repo-context`, `--module`)

Use `--repo-context` when asking repository-shape or architecture questions.

- It injects trusted Playbook-managed artifacts (for example `.playbook/repo-index.json` and AI contract metadata) into ask context.
- It avoids broad ad-hoc repository file inference.
- It requires repository intelligence from `pnpm playbook index` first.
- `--module <name>` narrows ask reasoning to trusted indexed context for that module.

Examples:

```bash
pnpm playbook index
pnpm playbook ask "where should a new feature live?" --repo-context
pnpm playbook ask "how does auth work?" --repo-context --mode concise
pnpm playbook ask "how does this work?" --module workouts --repo-context
pnpm playbook ask "what modules are affected by this?" --repo-context --json
```

If `.playbook/repo-index.json` is missing, ask returns deterministic remediation guidance to run `pnpm playbook index` and retry.

### Structured PR intelligence (`pnpm playbook analyze-pr`)

Use `pnpm playbook analyze-pr` for deterministic, machine-readable change analysis from local git diff + `.playbook/repo-index.json`.

- `pnpm playbook ask --diff-context` is conversational change reasoning.
- `pnpm playbook analyze-pr` is the structured review/report surface for automation and pre-merge checks.
- `pnpm playbook analyze-pr --json` remains the canonical deterministic analysis contract for automation.
- `pnpm playbook analyze-pr --format <text|json|github-comment|github-review>` selects presentation only over that contract.
- `pnpm playbook analyze-pr --format github-comment` renders the same deterministic analysis contract as a GitHub-ready PR summary markdown export.
- `pnpm playbook analyze-pr --format github-review` renders deterministic inline review annotations (`path`/`line`/`body`) derived from canonical findings in the analysis contract.
- GitHub Actions transport now posts summary formatter output as one sticky Playbook summary comment (`<!-- playbook:analyze-pr-comment -->`) and synchronizes inline diagnostics (`<!-- playbook:analyze-pr-inline -->`) so new diagnostics are added, existing ones are not duplicated, and resolved diagnostics are removed.
- The workflow layer is transport-only: it does not rebuild analysis or formatting outside `analyze-pr --format github-comment` and `analyze-pr --format github-review`.
- The workflow runs `pnpm playbook index` before `analyze-pr` because `.playbook/` directory creation alone is not sufficient; `analyze-pr` consumes `.playbook/repo-index.json`.
- In CI pull_request workflows, pass an explicit diff base (for example `--base origin/${{ github.base_ref }}`) and use full-history checkout (`fetch-depth: 0`) for deterministic diff resolution.

```bash
pnpm playbook index
pnpm playbook analyze-pr --format text
pnpm playbook analyze-pr --json
pnpm playbook analyze-pr --format github-comment
pnpm playbook analyze-pr --format github-review
```

### Change-scoped ask (`pnpm playbook ask --diff-context`)

Use `--diff-context` to answer branch/working-tree questions using trusted local diff + indexed intelligence.

- Requires `.playbook/repo-index.json` and local git diff availability.
- Produces deterministic changed-file, affected-module, impact, docs, and risk context.
- Never silently broadens into full-repo inference when diff context is unavailable.
- Optional `--base <ref>` narrows diff comparison against an explicit base (for example `main`).
- In `--json` mode, ask includes deterministic provenance metadata in `context.sources` so agents/CI can audit which indexed intelligence sources informed an answer (without exposing raw file contents).

```bash
pnpm playbook index
pnpm playbook ask "what modules are affected by this change?" --diff-context
pnpm playbook ask "what should I verify before merge?" --diff-context --mode concise
pnpm playbook ask "summarize the architectural risk of this diff" --diff-context --json
```

### AI Response Modes (`pnpm playbook ask --mode`)

`pnpm playbook ask` supports response modes to control answer density.

- `normal` (default): full explanation with context
- `concise`: compressed but still informative output
- `ultra`: maximum compression optimized for quick decisions

Examples:

```bash
pnpm playbook ask "how does auth work?"
pnpm playbook ask "how does auth work?" --repo-context --mode concise
pnpm playbook ask "how does this work?" --module workouts --repo-context
pnpm playbook ask "what modules are affected by this change?" --diff-context
pnpm playbook ask "how do I fix this rule violation?" --mode ultra
```

Authoritative command status lives in [docs/commands/README.md](docs/commands/README.md).

AI operating contract for this repository lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Managed command inventory/examples are generated from shared CLI command metadata via `pnpm agents:update` and validated with `pnpm agents:check`.

Managed command docs are generated and validated through a staged artifact pipeline with `pnpm docs:update` and `pnpm docs:check`, which regenerate candidate outputs first, validate roadmap/docs governance against those regenerated artifacts, and only then promote approved updates to `AGENTS.md`, `docs/commands/README.md`, and `docs/contracts/command-truth.json`.

Session knowledge hygiene is available via `pnpm playbook session cleanup --hygiene --dry-run --json-report .playbook/session-cleanup.report.json` for deterministic normalize/deduplicate/truncate/prune reporting.
Session continuity is repo-scoped and deterministic via `.playbook/session.json` with `pnpm playbook session show`, `pnpm playbook session pin <artifact>`, `pnpm playbook session resume`, and `pnpm playbook session clear`.

## Demo

See [`playbook-demo`](https://github.com/ZachariahRedfield/playbook-demo), also discoverable via `pnpm playbook demo`.

## Demo repository contract patterns

- Pattern: Demo repo should be command-shaped so the strongest product commands succeed in the standard happy path.
- Pattern: Demo artifacts should be generated by real CLI commands and committed under `.playbook/demo-artifacts/`.
- Rule: Demo documentation should summarize generated artifacts, not replace them as the source of truth.
- Rule: `explain <module>` examples in docs/demo must reference a module that is guaranteed to exist in `.playbook/repo-index.json`.
- Pattern: Add a single demo refresh script to regenerate index/explain/rules/verify/plan/apply/diagram/doctor outputs deterministically.
- Pattern: Cross-repo demo artifact refresh automation should run in dedicated maintenance workflows and open PRs against `ZachariahRedfield/playbook-demo` instead of mutating `main` directly.

## Canonical remediation workflow

Playbook's canonical remediation loop is:

`verify -> plan -> apply -> verify`

- `verify` detects deterministic policy findings.
- `plan` generates a reviewable remediation artifact (including JSON output for automation).
- `apply` executes deterministic auto-fixable tasks from a fresh plan or a serialized plan artifact.
- the final `verify` confirms the repository returns to policy-compliant state.

`fix` remains available as a convenience direct-remediation path (for example `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--only`) when you want a single-command local workflow instead of explicit plan/apply steps.

## Deterministic orchestration workflow

Use `pnpm playbook orchestrate --goal "<implementation goal>" --lanes 3 --format both` to compile a governance-safe lane contract set for parallel Codex plan-mode workers. The implemented v0 command writes `.playbook/orchestrator/orchestrator.json` plus lane prompt markdown artifacts (format-dependent), defines lane boundaries/dependencies, keeps prompts compact for humans, and reserves protected singleton docs for fragment-only contribution instead of direct concurrent edits. It remains control-plane only (no worker launch, branch, PR, or merge automation).
Use `pnpm playbook workers --json` or `pnpm playbook workers assign` to derive proposal-only worker assignment contracts from lane-state readiness and dependency gates. This writes `.playbook/worker-assignments.json` plus per-lane prompt handoff files in `.playbook/prompts/` without launching workers, creating branches, or automating PRs, while keeping full machine state in `.playbook` artifacts instead of duplicating it into worker prompts.

## Getting Started

Run:

```bash
pnpm playbook doctor
```

`pnpm playbook doctor` provides a high-level repository health report with framework, architecture, governance checks, and suggested next actions.

## AI Environment Diagnostics

Run:

```bash
pnpm playbook doctor --ai
```

This command verifies that the repository is correctly configured for AI-assisted Playbook workflows, including deterministic AI contract readiness validation (contract availability/validity, intelligence sources, required command/query surface, and remediation workflow readiness). It is the readiness gate before future Playbook agent execution.

Use `pnpm playbook doctor --help` to view doctor-specific flags, including `--ai`.

## How to discover capabilities

The CLI help output is the authoritative source for supported commands and flags.

- Use `pnpm playbook rules` to list available rules.
- Use `pnpm playbook explain <target>` to deterministically explain rules, modules, and architecture from `.playbook/repo-index.json` and the rule registry.

## Init Scaffold Contract

Running:

```bash
pnpm playbook init
```

guarantees the following baseline project artifacts:

- Playbook configuration (`playbook.config.json` or `.playbook/config.json`)
- `docs/PLAYBOOK_NOTES.md`

Other documentation such as `docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md` may be present depending on repository governance policies, but it is not required by the default scaffold.

## CLI command contract patterns

- Pattern: CLI Command Contract â€” Playbook CLI commands that produce JSON must maintain stable output contracts so AI agents and automation can rely on deterministic fields.
- Pattern: CLI Snapshot Contract Testing â€” `packages/cli/test/cliContracts.test.ts` snapshots deterministic JSON payloads for `rules --json`, `explain <target> --json`, `index --json`, `verify --json`, and `plan --json` into `tests/contracts/*.snapshot.json`; run `pnpm test:update-snapshots` only when contract changes are intentional.
- Pattern: CLI Smoke Testing â€” All CLI commands should be exercised by an automated smoke test to prevent runtime regressions.
- Rule: CLI Business Logic Location â€” CLI commands must remain thin wrappers around engine functionality.
- Pattern: Demo Alignment â€” The Playbook core repository must guarantee that commands used by the demo repository remain stable and testable.
- Pattern: Cross-Repo Pattern Learning â€” `pnpm playbook patterns cross-repo|portability|generalized|repo-delta` provides deterministic portability scoring from `.playbook/cross-repo-patterns.json` without introducing autonomous doctrine mutation.

## Architecture

The architecture diagrams in this repository are automatically generated by Playbook.

Run locally from this repository (internal execution):

```bash
pnpm -r build
pnpm playbook diagram --repo . --out docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md
```

For consumer-installed usage, run:

```bash
pnpm playbook diagram
```

Package-first runtime parity note: `@fawxzzy/playbook-cli` is now a thin entrypoint package that delegates directly to `@fawxzzy/playbook` runtime implementation, so consumer repos receive the same semantic `.playbook/*` artifacts (for example `findings.json`, `plan.json`, and `repo-graph.json`) instead of log-only shim behavior.

Or view architecture docs here:

- [docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md)
- [docs/architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md) (architecture layer ownership, seam contract, and closed-loop constraints)

This ensures architecture documentation always reflects the actual repository structure.

## Using Playbook with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is an optional provider integration. It is not required for Playbook verification truth.

Playbook includes an official composite action that supports deterministic CI automation for the canonical flow:

`verify -> plan -> review -> apply -> verify`

For repository CI validation, the canonical contract gates are `pnpm playbook verify --json`, roadmap contract validation, and `pnpm playbook docs audit --ci --json` (preceded by `pnpm -r build` and `pnpm test`).

Rule: CI should enforce deterministic product/governance correctness and roadmap-contract alignment.

Failure Mode: If delivery workflow rules (roadmap linkage and docs governance) are documented but not enforced in CI, roadmap drift accelerates.

The action runs from checked-out repository source (it installs with the workspace lockfile, builds the CLI, and invokes `node packages/cli/dist/main.js`). It does **not** require `npm install -g` or a published npm package.

The action lives at `./.github/action.yml` in this repository and accepts:

- `mode`: `verify | plan | apply`
- `plan-artifact`: required for `mode: apply`
- `repo-path`: optional, defaults to `.`
- `node-version`: optional, defaults to `22`
- `verify-args`: optional, defaults to `--ci`

### Optional maintenance workflow

Automation maintenance checks (managed docs regeneration/validation) can run outside the primary CI gate in a scheduled or manually triggered workflow. Managed docs follow the same default artifact shape used by demo refresh: generate → validate → promote, so stale generated artifacts are refreshed before governance validation runs:

- `pnpm agents:update`
- `pnpm agents:check`

See `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`.

### Demo refresh maintenance workflow

Cross-repo `playbook-demo` artifact/doc refresh automation is isolated from the main correctness CI path and runs through dedicated maintenance workflows:

- dry-run/integration: `.github/workflows/demo-integration.yml`
- PR-based refresh orchestration: `.github/workflows/demo-refresh.yml`

`demo-refresh` uses local branch-built CLI bits (`packages/cli/dist/main.js`) and runs `scripts/demo-refresh.mjs`, which:

- clones `ZachariahRedfield/playbook-demo`
- injects `PLAYBOOK_CLI_PATH`
- resolves refresh execution by package manager lockfile (`npm run <script>` for npm, `pnpm run <script>` for pnpm, `yarn run <script>` for yarn)
- runs refresh commands without `bash -lc` (argv/spawn execution)
- enforces an allowlist of committed generated surfaces
- configures git author identity in push mode (`PLAYBOOK_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `PLAYBOOK_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, with bot defaults)
- configures explicit token auth for push via `PLAYBOOK_DEMO_GH_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) and opens/updates a PR (never direct push to `main`).

Local usage:

- Safe default dry-run:
  - `node scripts/demo-refresh.mjs --dry-run`
- Push + PR mode:
  - `PLAYBOOK_DEMO_GH_TOKEN=<token> node scripts/demo-refresh.mjs --push --base main --feature-id PB-V1-DEMO-REFRESH-001`
- Optional overrides:
  - `PLAYBOOK_DEMO_REFRESH_CMD` (explicit refresh command override)
  - `PLAYBOOK_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `PLAYBOOK_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` (commit identity)

Workflow requirements for PR mode:

- secret: `PLAYBOOK_DEMO_GH_TOKEN`
- permissions: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`

Companion assumptions for demo-side script support are documented in `docs/integration/PLAYBOOK_DEMO_COMPANION_CHANGES.md`.

## Deterministic execution runs

Playbook now records multi-step remediation as first-class execution run state in `.playbook/runs/<run-id>.json`.

- Rule: Every multi-step remediation flow must be representable as a deterministic execution run artifact.
- Pattern: A system becomes agent-ready when actions are represented as inspectable state transitions rather than transient command output.
- Failure Mode: Without explicit run-state, the system cannot reliably resume, audit, compare, or learn from execution behavior.

Execution runs are appended by `verify`, `plan`, `apply`, and follow-up `verify`, and can be inspected via:

- `playbook query runs`
- `playbook query run --id <run-id>`

## Adoption readiness status

`pnpm playbook status --json` now includes a deterministic adoption/readiness contract for connected repositories:

- connection status and Playbook detection
- governed artifact presence/validity (`repo-index`, `repo-graph`, `plan`, `policy-apply-result`)
- lifecycle stage (`playbook_not_detected` -> `playbook_detected_index_pending` -> `indexed_plan_pending` -> `planned_apply_pending` -> `ready`)
- fallback-proof and cross-repo eligibility gates
- deterministic blockers and exact next command recommendations

Use this as the single operator status surface before running fallback proof or cross-repo comparison.
Run `pnpm playbook status proof --json` when you need an end-to-end external-consumer bootstrap proof. It deterministically validates runtime acquisition, local CLI resolution, initialization, required docs/governance artifacts, required execution state, and governed bootstrap contract success, then returns the single highest-priority next action if proof fails.

For portfolio-level triage, run `pnpm playbook status fleet --json` to aggregate lifecycle-stage counts, blocker frequencies, fallback/cross-repo eligibility counts, and deterministic `repos_by_priority` ordering across connected Observer repos.

For actionable execution sequencing, run `pnpm playbook status queue --json` to produce a deterministic, read-only adoption work queue with ordered work items, explicit dependencies, Wave 1/Wave 2 breakdown, and parallel-safe grouped action lanes.

For deterministic execution outcome ingestion, place operator-supplied prompt outcomes in `.playbook/execution-outcome-input.json` and run `pnpm playbook status receipt --json`. Playbook combines the current execution plan, current work queue, current readiness summary, and outcome input to emit a governed execution receipt that records prompt/wave/repo outcomes, artifact deltas, blockers, and planned-vs-actual lifecycle drift.

Receipt semantics:

- `intended_transition`: the lifecycle move implied by the planned lane (`connect` -> `playbook_not_detected`, `init` -> `playbook_detected_index_pending`, `index` -> `indexed_plan_pending`, `verify/plan` -> `planned_apply_pending`, `apply` -> `ready`).
- `observed_transition`: the lifecycle move proven by current governed readiness artifacts after execution.
- `status`: `success`, `failed`, `partial_success`, `mismatch`, or `not_run`, derived from the ingested operator outcome plus governed artifact evidence.

This receipt is designed to feed future prioritization cleanly: `verification_summary.repos_needing_retry[]` and `planned_vs_actual_drift[]` identify the exact repos/prompts that should return to the next deterministic work queue.

- Rule: execution receipts must prefer governed artifact evidence over operator claims whenever lifecycle state can be proven from readiness artifacts.
- Pattern: reuse execution plan + work queue + readiness as the only planning inputs so outcome ingestion does not invent a second reasoning system.
- Failure Mode: execution-outcome drift appears when operators report success but lifecycle evidence does not reach the planned target stage.

- Rule: identical readiness input must produce identical queue ordering, wave assignment, and execution-plan packaging.
- Pattern: execute grouped lanes in stage order (`init` -> `index` -> `verify/plan` -> `apply`) and keep one repo in one active lane per wave to reduce conflicts.
- Failure Mode: queue drift appears when dependent actions are run before prerequisite lane completion or when a repo is split across conflicting same-wave lanes.

- `playbook story list --json` exposes the canonical repo-local story backlog artifact at `.playbook/stories.json`.
- `playbook story candidates --json` derives and writes the non-canonical inspectable candidate artifact at `.playbook/story-candidates.json` without mutating `.playbook/stories.json`.
- `playbook story promote <candidate-id> --json` explicitly promotes one candidate into the canonical backlog artifact.
- `playbook promote story global/patterns/<pattern-id> --repo <repo-id> --json` explicitly seeds a repo-local story from promoted global pattern metadata while still writing only `.playbook/stories.json` in the target repo.
- `playbook route --story <id> --json` and `playbook story plan <id> --json` now attach read-only advisory `pattern_context` from promoted patterns, but only the repo-local story remains execution authority.
- `playbook promote` now emits deterministic audited receipts to `.playbook/promotion-receipts.json` for promoted, noop, and conflict outcomes so canonical knowledge mutation attempts remain inspectable through the same artifact-viewer path used elsewhere.
- `pnpm playbook patterns proposals --json` groups cross-repo comparisons into promotable portable-pattern/story candidates with evidence lineage and explicit governed promotion targets.
- `pnpm playbook patterns proposals promote --target memory` now lands as candidate-only input in `.playbook/memory/candidates.json`; it never auto-promotes imported/reused patterns into enforced doctrine.
- `pnpm playbook patterns transfer export --pattern <id> --target-repo <repo-id>` now emits deterministic transfer packages with provenance, sanitization status, compatibility metadata, risk class, known failure modes, and lifecycle hooks for later recall/demotion handling.
- `pnpm playbook patterns transfer import --file <path> --repo <repo-id>` imports those packages as candidate-only pattern input with fail-closed compatibility checks, pending local review, and no direct execution-planning effect.
- `pnpm playbook promote pattern-retire|pattern-demote|pattern-recall <pattern-id> --reason <text>` manages reusable-pattern lifecycle without removing receipt/audit lineage.
- `pnpm playbook patterns proposals promote --proposal <proposal-id> --target memory|story [--repo <repo-id>] --json` keeps cross-repo adoption explicit while bridging into reusable memory or canonical backlog surfaces.

- Rule: Stories are the durable repo-scoped action unit and must remain structured first, narrative second.
- Rule: Global knowledge may suggest local work, but only repo-local stories may enter execution planning.
- Pattern: Backlog state is a canonical repo-local artifact, not a UI-owned construct.
- Pattern: Findings need durable interpretation before they become backlog work.
- Pattern: Candidate stories require grouping, dedupe, and explicit promotion.
- Pattern: Reusable knowledge compounds when it can seed bounded local backlog items.
- Failure Mode: If story state is introduced without a canonical artifact and governed writes, backlog semantics fragment immediately.
- Failure Mode: Raw finding -> automatic story conversion creates backlog spam and weak planning signal.
- Failure Mode: Letting patterns enter execution directly creates a second control path and breaks operator trust.
- `pnpm playbook promote pattern ...` and global pattern read surfaces now normalize the canonical global reusable pattern store to `.playbook/patterns.json` under `PLAYBOOK_HOME`, with deterministic compatibility reads from legacy `patterns.json` during migration.
- Rule: One canonical storage contract per knowledge scope.
- Pattern: Scope-first knowledge resolution beats path inference.
- Rule: Review decisions that require action should become explicit handoff artifacts, not implicit human memory.
- Pattern: Recall -> review -> receipt -> handoff -> explicit promotion/supersession/doc revision.
- Failure Mode: Operators can record revise/supersede decisions, but without deterministic next-step packaging the remediation loop stalls.
- Failure Mode: Global pattern path drift creates operator confusion and hidden read/write mismatch.
