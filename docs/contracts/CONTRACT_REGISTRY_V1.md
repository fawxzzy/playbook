# Contract Registry (v1)

`pnpm playbook contracts` emits a deterministic, machine-readable registry that allows humans, CI, and agents to discover command schema surfaces, runtime artifact defaults, and tracked roadmap contract status from a single stable output.

## Contract scope

- Command: `pnpm playbook contracts --json`
- Schema version: `1.0`
- JSON Schema target: `pnpm playbook schema contracts --json`
- Default artifact path when written: `.playbook/contracts-registry.json`

## Payload shape

Top-level object fields:

- `schemaVersion`: fixed `"1.0"`
- `command`: fixed `"contracts"`
- `cliSchemas`:
  - `draft`: fixed `"2020-12"`
  - `schemaCommand`: fixed `"pnpm playbook schema --json"`
  - `commands`: deterministic list of CLI schema targets discoverable via `schema`
- `artifacts`:
  - `runtimeDefaults`: deterministic runtime artifact contract defaults and producers
  - `contracts`: deterministic list of selected docs contract files with structured availability and optional machine-readable roles plus optional paired export paths
  - `contractRoles`: deterministic role-to-path lookup rows for semantically important owner contracts, including the paired canonical machine export path when one exists
- `roadmap`:
  - `path`: fixed `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.json`
  - `availability`: structured availability state
  - `schemaVersion`: roadmap schema version when available, otherwise `null`
  - `trackedFeatures`: deterministic subset of tracked roadmap features (`featureId`, `status`)

## Workflow-pack discovery

The registry is the canonical discovery surface for the reusable workflow-pack bundle.

Registered workflow-pack docs include:

- `docs/contracts/LOCAL_VERIFICATION_RECEIPT_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/contracts/PLAYBOOK-CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/contracts/WORKFLOW_PROMOTION_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/contracts/WORKFLOW_PACK_REUSE_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/CONSUMER_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/contracts/ARTIFACT_EVOLUTION_POLICY.md`

Registered runtime defaults include the local-first verification receipt artifacts:

- `.playbook/local-verification-receipt.json`
- `.playbook/local-verification-receipts.json`

Workflow promotion remains a shared contract even when the committed output path varies by workflow. Consumers should discover the contract/schema through the registry and read the promoted artifact path from the workflow promotion payload itself.

The registry also publishes the core Playbook owner contract so downstream consumers can discover the structured handoff, promotion-target, and duplicate-truth rules through the same canonical registry path instead of relying on ad hoc links.

When a registered contract owns a special downstream adoption role, the entry may also publish a machine-readable `role` field. Current role values:

- `core_continuity_doctrine`: marks the canonical owner continuity contract (`docs/contracts/PLAYBOOK-CONTRACT.md`) that downstream handoff, restart, or promotion-routing surfaces must inherit instead of restating locally

The registry also publishes a compact `artifacts.contractRoles` lookup so downstream tooling can resolve semantically important owner contracts directly by role without scanning the full contracts list first. When a role also has one canonical machine export, that same row publishes `exportPath` so consumers can recover both the human contract and the machine export from one lookup.


## Schema registrations

The `schemas.commandOutputs` array includes additive command-output schema registrations. Current file-backed entries include:

- `packages/contracts/src/knowledge.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/pattern-graph.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/cross-repo-candidates.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/execution-plan.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/local-verification-receipt.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/workflow-promotion.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/promotion-receipt.schema.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/learning-state.schema.json`

## Determinism guarantees

The contract registry is deterministic by design.

- No timestamps are emitted by the `contracts` command itself.
- No absolute paths are emitted.
- No environment-volatile fields are emitted.
- Arrays are stably ordered before emission.
- Tracked roadmap features are sorted by `featureId`.

## Availability semantics

Optional sections degrade to structured availability states instead of failing in consumer repos or partial repos.

Availability object variants:

- Available:
  - `{ "available": true }`
- Unavailable:
  - `{ "available": false, "reason": "missing" | "not_applicable" | "parse_error" | "not_initialized" }`

Current usage:

- Contract document entries under `artifacts.contracts[*].availability`
- Contract role tagging under `artifacts.contracts[*].role`
- Paired canonical machine export path under `artifacts.contracts[*].exportPath` when present
- Direct semantic owner-contract lookup under `artifacts.contractRoles[*]`
- Roadmap availability under `roadmap.availability`

## Versioning and compatibility policy

- The registry follows additive compatibility expectations for `schemaVersion: "1.0"`.
- Breaking output changes require a schema version bump.
- New optional fields may be added in a backward-compatible manner.
- Contract changes must update:
  - `packages/engine/src/schema/cliSchemas.ts`
  - contract snapshots under `tests/contracts/`
  - this document and command documentation.
