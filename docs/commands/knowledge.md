# `pnpm playbook knowledge`

Inspect normalized knowledge artifacts through read-only deterministic surfaces.

Machine-readable `--json` output now carries additive `continuity.doctrine` metadata so knowledge inspection and deterministic failure envelopes preserve the canonical `core_continuity_doctrine` role, owner contract path, export path, and registration state alongside the existing read-only payloads.

Command boundary:
- `pnpm playbook memory ...` is the raw lifecycle/review/mutation surface for memory artifacts.
- `pnpm playbook knowledge ...` is the normalized read-only inspection/query surface.

## Subcommands

### `knowledge list`

List all evidence, candidate, promoted, superseded, and normalized global reusable pattern records. This now includes reviewable pattern lifecycle candidates emitted from runtime receipts, drift signals, promotion history, and later portability outcomes.

### `knowledge query`

Filter knowledge records with:

- `--type`
- `--status`
- `--lifecycle`
- `--module`
- `--rule`
- `--text`
- `--limit`

### `knowledge inspect <id>`

Inspect one knowledge record by id, including normalized lifecycle metadata, warnings, and supersession links.

### `knowledge compare <left-id> <right-id>`

Compare two knowledge records and surface overlapping evidence IDs, fingerprints, and related-record links.

### `knowledge timeline`

Show the knowledge timeline in deterministic order.

### `knowledge provenance <id>`

Resolve direct evidence and related-record lineage for one knowledge record.

### `knowledge supersession <id>`

Resolve deterministic `supersedes` / `superseded-by` chains for one knowledge record.

### `knowledge stale`

List stale candidates plus non-active knowledge (`retired`, `superseded`, and demoted global reusable patterns).

Lifecycle guarantees:

- Storage contract: `repo_local_memory` resolves from `.playbook/memory/knowledge/patterns.json`, `global_reusable_pattern_memory` resolves from `.playbook/patterns.json` under `PLAYBOOK_HOME` with deterministic compat-read fallback to legacy `patterns.json`, and `cross_repo_proposal_bridge` resolves from `.playbook/pattern-proposals.json`.
- Query surfaces distinguish `active`, `candidate`, `stale`, `retired`, `superseded`, and `demoted` lifecycle truth explicitly.
- Read-only inspection reveals lifecycle truth without mutating it.
- Lifecycle recommendations surface as candidate records sourced from `.playbook/memory/lifecycle-candidates.json`; they remain advisory-only and retain exact evidence references plus target pattern ids.
- Global reusable patterns are normalized into the same inspection surface as repo-local memory so provenance and supersession remain auditable from one command family.
- JSON list/query/timeline/stale summaries expose lifecycle counts in `summary.byLifecycle` alongside `byType` and `byStatus` so deterministic consumers can reason about lifecycle distribution without re-aggregating records.

### `knowledge portability`

Inspect deterministic cross-repo portability review surfaces.

Views:

- `overview` (default): portability scoring evidence (`source_repo`, `portability_score`, `evidence_runs`, compatible subsystems, risk signals)
- `recommendations`: transfer recommendations (`pattern`, `source_repo`, `target_repo`, `initial_portability_score`, `decision_status`, `evidence_count`)
- `outcomes`: decision/adoption outcomes (`pattern`, `source_repo`, `target_repo`, `initial_portability_score`, `adoption_status`, `observed_outcome`, `sample_size`)
- `recalibration`: confidence updates (`pattern`, `source_repo`, `target_repo`, `initial_portability_score`, `recalibrated_confidence`, `evidence_count`, `sample_size`)
- `transfer-plans`: proposal-only transfer plan rows from `.playbook/transfer-plans.json` (`pattern`, `source_repo`, `target_repo`, `portability_confidence`, `readiness_score`, `required_artifacts`, `required_validations`, `adoption_steps`, `risk_signals`, `gating_tier`, `blockers`, `open_questions`)
- `readiness`: compatibility/readiness rows from `.playbook/transfer-readiness.json` (`pattern`, `target_repo`, `readiness_score`, `recommendation`, required/missing subsystems, artifacts, validations, contracts, blockers, missing prerequisites, open questions)
- `blocked-transfers`: readiness subset where blockers or blocked recommendations are present, preserving the same audit fields used by `readiness`

### `knowledge review`

Materialize and inspect `.playbook/review-queue.json` through the existing retrieval review surface under the knowledge command family.

Filters:

- `--action reaffirm|revise|supersede`
- `--kind knowledge|doc|rule|pattern`
- `--due now|overdue|all` (default `all`)
- `--trigger cadence|evidence|all` (default `all`)
- `--trigger-source <source>` (exact trigger source match, e.g. `architecture-decision` or `interop-followup`)

Trigger metadata surfaced in JSON (`entries[*]` and persisted queue artifact):

- `triggerType`
- `triggerReasonCode`
- `triggerSource`
- `triggerEvidenceRefs`

Cadence fields surfaced in JSON (`entries[*]` when present and additive summaries):

- `nextReviewAt`
- `overdue`
- `deferredUntil`

Text output remains compact and operator-facing:

- status
- due now
- Evidence-triggered
- interop-triggered
- Next action

Cadence schedules recall, while evidence can reopen or raise recall priority without creating a new command family.

Review recording remains receipt-only; it does not auto-promote or auto-supersede doctrine.

JSON output and `.playbook/review-queue.json` preserve full deterministic trigger/cadence detail for automation consumers.

Architecture-decision recall is trigger-driven: `docs/architecture/decisions/*.md` must publish explicit `## Review Triggers` lines in canonical format:

- `- [trigger_id] when <observable condition> -> <required review action>`

Satisfied signals are merged as additive `triggerSource=architecture-decision` evidence entries.

Interop follow-up cues are merged into the same queue as additive `triggerSource=interop-followup` evidence entries, making interop-derived recall visible via existing `knowledge review` filtering.

Rule: Architecture decisions should be recalled through explicit trigger metadata, not ad hoc memory.

Pattern: Queue + receipt + cadence + evidence + decision triggers = governed review.

Failure Mode: Architecture review triggers live only in docs and never become operational review signals.

### `knowledge review handoffs`

Materialize and inspect proposal-only follow-up handoffs from retrieval review outcomes using `.playbook/review-handoffs.json`.
Compile deterministic downstream routing suggestions into `.playbook/review-handoff-routes.json` so next governed surfaces are explicit.

Filters:

- `--decision revise|supersede`
- `--kind knowledge|doc|rule|pattern`

Text output stays brief-thin:

- status
- affected targets
- recommended follow-up
- next action

Behavior guarantees:

- proposal-only handoff visibility
- no auto-promotion
- no auto-supersession
- no second mutation executor
- full detail retained in JSON output and `.playbook/review-handoffs.json`
- deterministic route detail retained in `.playbook/review-handoff-routes.json` with no auto-mutation authority

Routing matrix (canonical, compact, and aligned to routed artifact fields):

| `decision` | `kind` | routed follow-up surface | routing semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `revise` | `doc` | docs revision | route a docs follow-up handoff (`recommendedFollowUp=docs-revision`) |
| `revise` | `knowledge` / `rule` / `pattern` | promote/memory follow-up | route a promotion-oriented follow-up handoff (`recommendedFollowUp=promote-or-memory`) |
| `supersede` | `knowledge` / `rule` / `pattern` | supersession follow-up | route a supersession follow-up handoff (`recommendedFollowUp=supersession`) |
| `defer` | any | none | no immediate route (receipt only) |
| `reaffirm` | any | none | no route (receipt only) |

### `knowledge review routes`

Materialize and inspect proposal-only routed follow-up suggestions from retrieval handoffs using `.playbook/review-handoff-routes.json`.

Filters:

- `--surface story|promote|docs|memory`
- `--decision revise|supersede`
- `--kind knowledge|doc|rule|pattern`

Text output stays brief-thin:

- status
- affected targets
- recommended surface
- next action

Behavior guarantees:

- proposal-only routed visibility
- no write or mutation path
- no auto-promotion
- no auto-supersession
- full route detail retained in JSON output and `.playbook/review-handoff-routes.json`

### `knowledge review followups`

Materialize and inspect compiled downstream follow-up suggestions using `.playbook/review-downstream-followups.json`.

Filters:

- `--kind knowledge|doc|rule|pattern`
- `--surface story|promote|docs|memory`

Text output stays brief-thin:

- status
- affected targets
- recommended surface
- next action

Behavior guarantees:

- proposal-only follow-up visibility
- no write or mutation path
- full deterministic detail retained in JSON output and `.playbook/review-downstream-followups.json`

### `knowledge review record`

Record a durable retrieval review outcome in `.playbook/knowledge-review-receipts.json` from an existing queue entry.

Required options:

- `--from <queueEntryId>`
- `--decision reaffirm|revise|supersede|defer`

Optional options:

- `--reason-code <id>`
- `--evidence-ref <value>` (repeatable)
- `--followup-ref <value>` (repeatable; first value is stored as `followUpArtifactPath`)
- `--receipt-id <id>` (stable overwrite semantics for repeated writes)

Behavior guarantees:

- records the review receipt only
- does not auto-promote
- does not auto-supersede
- does not mutate active doctrine

Text output remains thin:

- decision
- affected target
- next action

JSON output and `.playbook/knowledge-review-receipts.json` preserve full deterministic detail.

- Failure Mode: Review handoffs become a dead-end list instead of a governed bridge to action.
- Failure Mode: Handoffs can exist while next steps still require manual reconstruction when routed follow-up artifacts are missing.
