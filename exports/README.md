# Playbook Contract Exports

Downstream consumers should read these files directly:

- `docs/contracts/PLAYBOOK-CONTRACT.md`
- `exports/playbook.contract.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.contract.example.v1.json`

Canonical commandless research exports now also include:

- `exports/playbook.research.project-profile.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.project-profile.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.pattern-set.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.pattern-set.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.integration-map.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.integration-map.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.roadmap-diff.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.research.roadmap-diff.example.v1.json`

Canonical commandless scorecard exports now also include:

- `exports/playbook.repo-scorecard.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.repo-scorecard.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.repo-scorecard.report.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.repo-scorecard.report.example.v1.json`

When an input or report artifact cites a semantically tagged owner contract, published examples may also preserve additive `contractRole` / `contractRoles` metadata so downstream readers can resolve continuity doctrine semantically instead of by path convention alone.

Those same artifacts may also preserve paired `contractExportPath` / `contractExportPaths` metadata so downstream readers can recover the canonical machine export directly from the report family instead of doing a second registry lookup.

The canonical Playbook contract export also publishes `continuity_requirements.contract_role: "core_continuity_doctrine"` so continuity-aware consumers can recover the owner doctrine identity directly from the export itself.
 
Canonical commandless golden-path template exports now also include:

- `exports/playbook.golden-path-template.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.golden-path-template.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.golden-path-template-registry.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.golden-path-template-registry.example.v1.json`

Canonical commandless workflow-pack environment bridge exports now also include:

- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.report.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.report.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.plan.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.plan.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.executor.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.executor.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.executor-receipt.schema.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.executor-receipt.example.v1.json`

Draft/review exports may also appear here when new contract surfaces are being proposed. Those files are advisory until the corresponding contract/docs surface is promoted.

Use the export as read-only owner truth. Do not copy its doctrine into a second canonical store.
