- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.example.v1.json`
- `exports/playbook.workflow-pack.environment-bridge.report.schema.v1.json`

The canonical project-board owner export is:

- `exports/playbook.project-board.owner-export.v1.json`

It is generated from `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.json` with `pnpm board:export` and
must remain byte-current under `pnpm board:export:check`. Atlas Contracts owns
the shared schema and semantic validation used before DiscordOS admission.

Draft/review exports may also appear here when new contract surfaces are being proposed. Those files are advisory until the corresponding contract/docs surface is promoted.

Use the export as read-only owner truth. Do not copy its doctrine into a second canonical store.
